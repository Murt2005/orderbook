## Architecture & Design

### Core Components

**Order Book Engine**
- Price level management with sorted bid/ask queues
- O(log n) price level access, O(1) order lookup
- Automatic cleanup of empty price levels
- Thread-safe design with read-write locks
- Atomic operations for state management

**Matching Algorithm**
- Price-time priority implementation
- Partial fill support across multiple price levels
- Price improvement rules (orders execute at better prices)
- Atomic trade execution with comprehensive validation

**Order Management**
- Smart pointer-based memory management
- Cancel-and-replace semantics for order modifications
- Order state tracking (initial, remaining, filled quantities)
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling

**Performance Tracking**
- Nanosecond-precision timing for all operations
- Statistical analysis (min, max, average execution times)
- Operations per second calculations
- Memory usage and efficiency metrics
- Thread-safe performance monitoring

### Data Structures

```cpp
// Price level management with custom sorting
std::map<Price, OrderPointers, std::greater<Price>> bids_;  // High to low
std::map<Price, OrderPointers, std::less<Price>> asks_;     // Low to high

// O(1) order lookup for cancellations and modifications
std::unordered_map<OrderId, OrderEntry> orders_;

// FIFO queues within each price level
std::list<OrderPointer> orderQueue;

// Thread synchronization primitives
mutable std::shared_mutex orderBookMutex_;     // Read-write locks
mutable std::mutex performanceMutex_;          // Performance tracking
std::atomic<bool> isProcessing_{false};        // Atomic state flag
```

## Technical Implementation

### Thread Safety Implementation

The order book implements comprehensive thread safety using modern C++17 synchronization primitives:

**Read-Write Locks**
```cpp
// Read operations use shared locks (multiple readers)
std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(orderBookMutex_);
auto size = orders_.size();

// Write operations use exclusive locks (single writer)
std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(orderBookMutex_);
orders_.insert({orderId, orderEntry});
```

**Atomic Operations**
```cpp
std::atomic<bool> isProcessing_{false};  // Thread-safe state management
```

**Performance Benefits**
- **Concurrent Reads**: Multiple threads can read order book state simultaneously
- **Exclusive Writes**: Order modifications maintain data consistency
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only ~10-15% performance impact from synchronization
- **Race Condition Prevention**: All shared data access is properly synchronized

**Thread Safety Validation**
- **Concurrency Tests**: 10 threads (8 workers + 2 readers) with 8,000 operations
- **Data Integrity**: Price-time priority maintained across all operations
- **Performance**: 235,000+ operations per second with concurrent access

### Order Types Supported

**Good-Till-Cancel (GTC)**
- Standard limit orders that remain active until cancelled
- Full price-time priority matching
- Support for partial fills across multiple price levels

**Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC)**
- Orders that execute immediately or are rejected
- Liquidity validation before order placement
- Automatic cleanup of unfilled portions

**Fill-Or-Kill (FOK)**
- Orders that must be completely filled or rejected
- Complete fill validation across all available liquidity
- Atomic execution or complete rejection

### Performance Optimizations

**Memory Management**
- Smart pointer usage for automatic memory cleanup
- RAII patterns for exception safety
- Pre-allocated containers to reduce dynamic allocation
- Efficient STL container usage with minimal overhead

**Algorithmic Efficiency**
- O(log n) price level access for matching
- O(1) order lookup for cancellations
- O(1) order insertion within price levels
